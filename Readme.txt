You need to add simple error checking to you image uploads to prohibit users from uploading files that are too large.

Documentation did not contain any information about how to install or update the site as specified.

Even though your were creating an application, creating a website without any content other than navigation makes for a very poor presentation to the client (and a very poor submission as a student who has completed three web design/development classes).

For clarity and better usability, customers should be shown by name in a table, not just by number.

Search does not appear to be working fully.

If you are logged in and on an admin page, and click any of the other links, it appears that you are logged out and have not way to get back without logging in again.  Sessions should persist throughout the site.

When I login as a client and click "edit" (which is really hidden at the edge of the screen) nothing happens.

While it appears that you have learned many of the concepts presented in this class, I don't get the feeling that you put the time into creating the application that you are capable of doing.  There are still a lot of holes in both the execution and usability of the application.  I hope that you take the time to clean this up so that you can use it for a portfolio piece as a programmer.
